US-006 is complete. Summary of what was implemented:

**US-006: Complete todo interaction with animation**

- ✅ Click checkbox to toggle completion
- ✅ Completing: checkbox fills with subtle animation (blue bg + checkmark SVG with fade)
- ✅ Completing: title gets strikethrough + fades (opacity-60)
- ✅ Completing: item slides out with fly transition after 300ms delay
- ✅ Use Svelte transitions (fly, fade) for animations
- ✅ Animation duration ~300ms, eased (cubicOut)
- ✅ Rapid clicks handled correctly (blocked during animation)
- ✅ Uncompleting toggles immediately (no animation delay needed)

All quality gates pass (build, lint, check) and browser testing confirmed the animations work as expected.
