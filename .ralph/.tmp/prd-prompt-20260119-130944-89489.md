A simple todo app with a single list - no projects, tags, or other fancy features. Design inspired by Things 3 from Cultured Code: clean, minimal, generous whitespace, subtle animations. Stack: Vite + Svelte + Tailwind CSS. Use LocalStorage for persistence, no login required (device-local only). Focus on simplicity and aesthetics.
