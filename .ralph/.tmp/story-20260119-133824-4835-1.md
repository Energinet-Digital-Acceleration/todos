Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001

Description:
As a user, I want my todos persisted so they survive page refresh.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create todos store using Svelte writable store
- [ ] Store shape: array of {id, title, completed, createdAt}
- [ ] Generate unique IDs with crypto.randomUUID()
- [ ] Subscribe to store changes and save to LocalStorage
- [ ] Load from LocalStorage on app init
- [ ] Export functions: addTodo, toggleTodo, deleteTodo, clearCompleted
- [ ] Example: add todo -> appears in store and LocalStorage
- [ ] Example: refresh page -> todos restored from LocalStorage
- [ ] Negative case: corrupt LocalStorage JSON -> reset to empty array
